Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/ZooTree/ZooTree/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page. You will be redirected to the [.github folder](/.github/) of this project, where the README translations are hosted.

Translations are currently done with Bing translate and DeepL. Support for Google Translate translations is coming to a close due to privacy concerns.

### Pre-history

This project was started on 2021 Monday December 6th at 4:49 pm, shortly after creating an organization for the project. It had been on a private todo list for a while, and the project was started today. It received a little amount of work before development paused.

### Alpha history

Development resumed on 2021 Friday December 10th. The project received tons of work on this day, including hundreds of lines of Elm source code for a Ubuntu release, along with GLSL shader data, and a Manpage. It currently only supports the latest release of Ubuntu.

On 2021 Saturday December 11th, development continued. The project was updated further, and all the graphics from the source game were re-uploaded. The project also received its own website and Snapcraft template, along with support for more versions of Ubuntu, and different Linux distributions (as of 4:42 pm)

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](/DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
