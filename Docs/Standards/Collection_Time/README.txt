Critter collection times

Any critter added to the game must contain 1 of any of the following collection times:

30 seconds (0.5 minutes)
300 seconds (5 minutes)
900 seconds (15 minutes)
1800 seconds (30 minutes)
3600 seconds (60 minutes) (1 hour)
7200 seconds (120 minutes) (2 hours)
14400 seconds (240 minutes) (4 hours)
28800 seconds (480 minutes) (8 hours)
43200 seconds (720 minutes) (12 hours)
86400 seconds (1440 minutes) (24 hours) (1 day)

Critters cannot have multiple collection times, or collection times even a planck second off from the specified times above.

These times are here to keep true with the original game, and also because they work really well.
